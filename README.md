# Envision

## Electric city Hackathon 2019 - 37 Hours of Development

We have implemented the android mobile application. Envision is developed using machine learning algorithm called KNN. It is mainly used to forecast bank loan defaulter, breast cancer and bankruptcy. This prediction tool is designed to target vast variety of binary classification problems. We developed the KNN algorithm with high accuracy and precision. Futhermore, we trained this algorithm on huge amount data and tested it regourously. Here, we attached confusion matrix of machine learning algorithm used in this application.
